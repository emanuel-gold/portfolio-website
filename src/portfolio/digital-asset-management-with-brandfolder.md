## A Confusion-Free Solution

We all know the struggle: someone sends **Final\_Copy\_v2\_Edited(final(FOR-REAL))\_3.pdf** out to a client or internal stakeholder. A few minutes later, you get the dreaded reply-all email saying “Sorry, that wasn’t the final copy… the actual final version is attached, please forward and sorry for the confusion.”

## The Problem:

The marketing team faced several difficulties in managing their digital assets, including:

1.  Inefficient file-sharing methods (such as cloud drive storage and FTP servers) were slow and unreliable.
2.  Difficulty keeping track of different versions of digital assets, leading to confusion, errors, and circulation of outdated materials.
3.  Lack of access control for digital assets, putting sensitive information at risk.

## Overview

A B2B professional services company’s in-house marketing team created and distributed digital marketing materials including high-resolution graphics, photos, videos, brochures, and presentations. The team struggled with several challenges in managing and distributing its digital assets. To name a few, there was no way to control duplicates, no document versions, no access controls, and limited searchability.

For example, if the sales team saved an outdated graphic on their computer’s hard drive, we could not update that for them or prevent them from distributing it to prospects.

After assessing these problems and weighing feedback from the team, I came to the conclusion that a digital asset management (DAM) platform was needed to address these pain points.

The implementation of Brandfolder was a success for the in-house marketing team. The DAM solution helped the team streamline operations, save time and resources, and enhance security. The team was able to work more efficiently, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring that their digital assets were managed correctly.

## Unique Challenges

As a Digital Marketing Manager, my team needed a solution that would help them streamline their operations, save time and resources, and enhance security. Since this was a relatively large company, I had to coordinate with several departments, including IT, legal, and security, to set up the new software.

We also needed to ensure that the new solution would be easy for everyone to use, regardless of their technical skills. Many employees’ day-to-day jobs don’t involve using complex technology, so I had to make sure my DAM solution was simple and straightforward.

## Goals & Strategy

My goal was to identify and implement a DAM software that would address organizational challenges and improve the efficiency of the marketing team’s digital asset management process. After conducting extensive research, I decided to implement Brandfolder, a cloud-based digital asset management solution.

My strategy was to assess the needs of each department to make sure we would serve them in the best possible way. This involved working with Brandfolder’s implementation team to set up the new system and then train our team members to use it effectively.

The product specialists at Brandfolder knew the platform inside and out, so they were able to advise us on general best practices as well as tailor certain features for our specific use cases.

## Execution

I collaborated with Brandfolder’s implementation team to set up the new system, which involved migrating more than 3,000 existing digital assets to Brandfolder’s cloud-based platform. I worked closely with the company’s IT and Information Security teams to ensure that the new solution met industry-leading security requirements.

To ensure that everyone on the marketing team understood how to use the new system, I leveraged Brandfolder’s “train the trainers” model. I attended Brandfolder’s in-depth training sessions, then passed this information along to the marketing team. While platform admins were trained to be subject matter experts in managing Brandfolder, the rest of the marketing team only needed practical knowledge on how to organize and manage assets within Brandfolder. This approach made sure the team remained focused and wouldn’t be overwhelmed with too much info.

Finally, I put together a plan to train employees outside of the marketing team on how to use Brandfolder. Working with the company’s internal learning & development team, I created interactive Brandfolder training sessions that would be available to all employees during onboarding and on-demand.

## Results

The implementation of Brandfolder was a success. The solution helped the marketing team streamline their operations, save time and resources, and enhance security. The team was able to work more efficiently, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring that their digital assets were properly managed.

The marketing team reported that they were now able to deliver marketing materials to the sales and customer success teams much faster than before. Additionally, Brandfolder’s granular access controls allowed the team to determine who had access to their digital assets, which helped to enhance security. Overall, the successful implementation of Brandfolder resulted in a more efficient digital asset management process for the entire company.
