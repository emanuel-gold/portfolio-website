## The Problem:

A growing nonprofit faced a common challenge: keeping their customer data synchronized between their website and customer relationship management (CRM) system. Every time a member signed up or updated their information, the digital marketing and sales teams had to manually enter the data into HubSpot, their CRM of choice. This was a costly and error-prone process that the company needed to automate.

## Overview

As a digital marketing expert, I was tasked with finding a solution to streamline the customer data management processes at a growing nonprofit organization. We were facing the common challenge of keeping our customer data synchronized between our website’s membership management software and the HubSpot CRM.

Every time a new member signed up or an existing member updated their information, our account management and sales teams had to manually enter the data into HubSpot. This was a time-consuming and error-prone process that needed to be automated to ensure data accuracy and save our teams valuable time.

After researching different solutions, I decided to implement WP Fusion, a WordPress plugin that integrates with various CRMs, including HubSpot. WP Fusion would allow our WordPress-hosted membership management software’s data to be automatically synced with the CRM, improving data accuracy and saving us time and resources.

## Unique Challenges

While the implementation of WP Fusion was straightforward, the company faced the challenge of mapping its membership data fields in WordPress to the corresponding fields in HubSpot. The team had to ensure that the data was mapped correctly to avoid discrepancies between the two systems. It took time and careful attention to detail for the team to test all newly created properties in HubSpot.

## Goals & Strategy

Our primary goals were to automate the process of keeping member information up-to-date in both systems, improve data accuracy, and leverage the power of HubSpot CRM to improve our marketing campaigns and increase engagement with our members. By setting up custom automation rules in HubSpot, we could trigger different actions based on user behavior on our website. This allowed our marketing team to easily target different groups of members with relevant campaigns, leading to increased engagement and revenue.

Our strategy was first to analyze our existing data fields in WordPress and HubSpot, and then determine which fields needed to be mapped to ensure accurate data transfer between the two systems. Since the nonprofit offered different membership types, I had to ensure that the automation rules were set up correctly to target the right groups of members and assign them to the appropriate lists in HubSpot.

I also had to ensure that our account management team was trained on the new system and understood the new automation rules.

## Execution

I started by setting up the WP Fusion plugin and mapping the membership data fields in WordPress to the corresponding fields in HubSpot. The plugin was easy to set up and, once all the fields were correctly created and mapped, allowed seamless data synchronization between the website and CRM. WP Fusion allowed us to set up automation rules that triggered different actions in HubSpot based on user behavior on our website.

For example, we set up a rule that would assign new members to a specific HubSpot list based on their membership level. This allowed our marketing team to easily target these members with relevant campaigns.

## Results

The implementation of WP Fusion was a success, saving the marketing and sales teams hours of manual data entry each week and improving data accuracy. The teams were able to focus on more strategic tasks, knowing that member information was always up-to-date in both systems.
