## RAMPQuest – Simplifying Cybersecurity

RAMPQuest is a cybersecurity company that aims to simplify cybersecurity compliance. RAMPQuest offers expertise in consulting services, security program management, and risk assessment to some of the nation's largest cloud service providers.

Formerly operating as a department within Knowledge Services, RAMPQuest became its own fully-formed brand in 2025. A significant part of the go-to-market strategy was a fresh, unique website to let RAMPQuest stand out to new clients while remaining relevant to existing clients.

## My Approach

-   **Clarifying Complex Services –**  My goal was to build a modern website that clearly explains the different services that RAMPQuest offers.
-   **Industry-Specific Relevance –**  The site demonstrates how RAMPQuest addresses the unique cybersecurity needs of each industry it serves, whether it's GovRAMP compliance for private industries or policy development for state governments.
-   **Mission & Values Front and Center –**  Because VSO is powered by U.S. military veterans, we made their commitment to service, reliability, and accountability a core part of the website experience.
-   **Scalability –**  Built with the needs of a growing corporation in mind, the website was designed and developed to be marketer-friendly. Every module was built with the next person in mind so anyone can jump in and edit without a fight. 

In fact, the entire website was seamlessly migrated from WordPress into the powerful HubSpot CMS with nearly no rework and zero downtime. 

## A Strategic Site for Cybersecurity Experts

RAMPQuest's new website is the platform its team needs to deliver simplified cybersecurity services to their clients. 

The site demonstrates RAMPQuest's committment to simplifying cybersecurity by relating each service to their target audience's needs, while remaining approachable to cybersecurity newcomers.
